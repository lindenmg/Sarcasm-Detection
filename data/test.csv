5xfgdl	what drawbacks does legacy mode have?	legacy as a high chance of high hitting but the hits are way too slow compared to someone using eoc and since they cant have someone constantly hitting 10k the dps is generally lower for legacy, you cant free yourself from stuns which at low levels doesnt affect you so use this time to learn eoc, but with bossing managing to avoid being stunned is very important not to mention you cant surge which is also pretty handy for alot of situations you can only use special attacks when the bar refills which is the way it has always been but with eoc you can also use special attacks at a much faster rate because you gain adrenaline every hit it is more afk since you dont have to keep using thresholds but managing your thresholds correctly increases your dps greatly for slayer and other especially low level content, legacy might be better because you can 1hit everything which can increase xp/hr best example i have is first few magic levels you can get wand/orb of something and cast air spells insanely quick which is comparable with eoc speed but the damage of legacy which is pretty strong so it is your choice, but i suggest by the time you want to go godwars dungeon, if you arent level 120+ that you learn full manual so you can avoid the bosses similar to the osrs zilyana method but with eoc, it is alot less viable with legacy	0

"Because people like free stuff and Blizzard made the mistake of feeding them a little bit earlier,now they all came in hungry hordes and they are suprised Blizzard is not felling like giving away the freely obtainable contents for everyone... Some say hurdurr but the new players won't be able to catch up and its not actually free...but in the end if they gave away free packs to like accounts of 1 month old or less they would be even angrier because they didn't get some :P All in all since there was a precedent of getting packs free people expected the same this time and was dissapointed that they didn't get some,if there was no precedent they wouldn't had expectations... Sure I would have loved to get free packs too ,but I understand not giving away my stuff to other people,just because I did gave to some strangers some small change when they asked it does not mean I will give everytime I run into someone begging...I know it feels bad not to get the free packs,but come on people,if they give away free stuff its cool,if they don't its understandable,their game their profit,I don't go in a bar expecting to give me beer for free because they handed out free coca-cola samples at the entrance :P Brrr I expect to be downvoted for my opinion on ""siding with Blizzard"" but in the end I'm just accepting the facts and using common sense,no insult was meant to the dissapointed people :)"	0
