CNN can model syntax semantics
Attention mechanism
Add inputlayer size to hyperparameters

Architecture suggestion: 
INPUT CNN - concat + cosine similarity - FNN - OUTPUT

keep punctuation

add words like "!!!" or "..." to the word embeddings

try bigger windows in CNN

try different numbers of filters

try low dropout and then decreate

lower dimensionality for post vectors (at hidden layer, not at input)

try word2vec
