We have 218,362 post-reply pairs in total. For each post there is  one non-sarcastic reply and one sarcastic reply. The annotation of sarcastic replies is inferred from a '\textbackslash s' at the end of the text. 
This is a Reddit specific convention that is used by some users to point out, that their text is sarcastic. As not every user uses this tag for self-annotating sarcasm, it is obvious that
the dataset contains a lot of noise.  Also there might be links, pictures or videos in the original posts which ate not visible in the data and hence another source of noise. As the dataset only contains short texts, there are a lot of features missing, like the attitude of the author, which makes this a hard problem.
%We have 218362 post-reply pairs in total. For each post in the dataset there are
%two corresponding replies. One of those is sarcastic according to its author the other serious. That is based on the fact, that Reddit users have the option
%to tag their reply as sarcastic with \textbackslash s. Unfortunately there is a lot of noise,
%because not everyone uses this tag and sarcasm is also dependent on the attitude of the writer.
%In addition a substantial amount of posts where just links to further content which we can't see.

\textbf{*Human survey:}\\
We have asked six people to classify a distinct set of 20 post-replies each.
There were no serious + sarcastic reply pairs for a post, so they could not determine based on a comparison which is sarcasm and which is not. We have to emphasise at that point, that all of the six different datasets got only classified by one person. The average accuracy is 63.3\%. The range is 40\% - 80\%.

An investigation on how well a DNN - e.g. cut base model - can be used as feature generator for other state-of-the-art classification algorithms (non-NN-algorithms). This shall then be compared to the base model - which will be a pure NN approach.
